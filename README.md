# 🧠 Learning Data Science

This is my personal data science learning journey — a structured deep-dive into Python, SQL, machine learning, AI, and real-world projects.

## 🗂️ Structure

- `01_PythonBasics/` — Python syntax, data structures, loops, functions
- `02_SQL/` — SQL query practice, joins, window functions
- `03_StatisticsProbability/` — Stats, probability, A/B testing
- `04_MachineLearning/` — ML models, feature engineering, scikit-learn
- `05_AI_DeepLearning/` — Neural nets, NLP, CV, transformers
- `06_TimeSeries/` — Forecasting, ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM
- `07_DataVisualization/` — Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau dashboards
- `08_Projects/` — Real-world problem-solving end-to-end projects
- `09_Notes_CheatSheets/` — PDF notes, Markdown, LaTeX summaries
- `10_Deployments/` — Deployed apps (Flask, Streamlit, HuggingFace)

## 🧪 Environment Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
